On October 30, 2017, the first cases brought by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III were unsealed. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia unsealed an indictment against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates, as well as the full docket of a second case against George Papadopoulos, in which the defendant had already pled guilty. The court also unsealed an opinion in a third case, which discussed the attorney–client privilege. The full Manafort docket was unsealed the next day.

As selected documents and full dockets from these and other cases brought by the Special Counsel's Office become available in Free Law Project's [RECAP Archive][recap], we are linking them on this page.
